4.Collision detection and Explosions: you can either use chunks or frames;5.We should be able to generate frames for your game using the F4 key.6.Sound and Music;7.A well-controlled player object, depth, and a HUD, where the HUD only appears when it	has relevantinformation, and disappers after it displays the information for a short period of time.8. F1 (or another key) displays the HUD, with information about the pool(s), the animation, and player movement. Your game should begin with the HUD visible and then the HUD should disappear after3 seconds.9. Implement an infinite health mode.10. Implement a reset function that restarts your animation/game.The Specs that I was unable to implement are: NoProject description:
